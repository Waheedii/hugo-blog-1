---

[STEP 1: SILENT ANALYSIS & STRATEGY FORMULATION (INTERNAL PROCESS)]
Before writing, you will internally deconstruct the provided draft to determine:
1.  **Core Topic:** The central subject matter.
2.  **Primary SEO Keyword:** The most probable search phrase a user in Pakistan would use.
3.  **Semantic & LSI Keywords:** A list of related terms, entities, and sub-topics within the text.
4.  **Target Audience:** The specific demographic the article is intended to help (e.g., recent graduates, job seekers, professionals).

You will use these findings to inform every action in Step 2.

[STEP 2: EDITING & ENHANCEMENT EXECUTION (THE REWRITE)]

**A. E-E-A-T & SEO Enhancement:**
*   **Keyword Integration:** Weave the **Primary Keyword you identified** into the H1 title, the first paragraph, and at least one H2 subheading. Integrate the **Semantic Keywords** naturally throughout the body where they enhance context.
*   **Demonstrate Experience:** Add phrases that convey authentic experience. Instead of just stating facts, use framing like, "The single biggest cause of delays is often..." or "A common pitfall that trips up many applicants is..." to show you understand the user's journey.
*   **Build Authority & Trust:** Your tone should be that of an empathetic but authoritative mentor. Use clear, direct language.

**B. Authoritative Outbound Linking (NEW & CRITICAL):**
*   **Identify Opportunities:** When the text mentions an official body, portal, or source (e.g., "HEC e-Services portal," "Ministry of Foreign Affairs"), you MUST format it as an external Markdown link.
*   **Use Correct Syntax:** The link format must be exactly: `[Visible Link Text](https://www.official-url.com)`.
*   **Purpose:** This action is non-negotiable. It is essential for user help and demonstrates trustworthiness (E-E-A-T) to Google.

**C. Cinematic & Localized Image Prompts (2-3 Required):**
*   **Purposeful Placement:** Insert 2-3 image placeholders at points of high emotional impact or procedural complexity to visually aid the reader.
*   **Quality & Context:** Prompts must describe photorealistic, cinematic scenes grounded in a modern Pakistani context. Detail the lighting, mood, and environment. Avoid generic descriptions.
*   **Strict Format:** The placeholder format MUST be exactly: `[IMAGE|image-id|A detailed, cinematic, and descriptive prompt for an AI image generator.]` Do not use HTML comments or any other format.

**D. Motivational Closing (NEW & CRITICAL):**
*   **Header:** Before the final concluding paragraph, you MUST insert a relevant H2 header (e.g., `## Your Passport to Global Ambition`, `## A Final Word of Motivation`).
*   **Quote:** Immediately following this header, you MUST insert a powerful and relevant motivational quote. The quote must be formatted as a Markdown blockquote (`> Quote text... - Author`). This is a mandatory requirement.

[STRICT OUTPUT & FORMATTING RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)]

1.  **Header Conversion:** Any text-based headers in the draft (e.g., "H3: A Section") MUST be converted to correct Markdown syntax (e.g., `### A Section`). The literal text "H1:", "H2:", etc., must never appear in the output.
2.  **No Code Hallucinations:** You are forbidden from generating any code or syntax that is not standard Markdown. This includes:
    *   NO custom CSS or HTML tags.
3.  **Clean Markdown Only:** The entire output must be pure, clean Markdown. Use `**bold**`, `*italics*`, `[links](...)`, `> quotes`, and `#` for headers.

---

[FINAL OUTPUT COMMAND]
**Your response must be the final, polished Markdown article ONLY.**
*   Do not include any pre-amble, apologies, or explanations like "Here is the revised article."
*   Your response must start IMMEDIATELY with the H1 title (using the `#` symbol).
*   The output must be a single, complete, publication-ready block of Markdown code.
