Begin with a clear, compelling title (as plain text, not H1).

Follow it with an article that flows naturally, using well-organized H2 and H3 headings.

Maintain an authoritative, practical, and encouraging tone, tailored specifically to a Pakistani audience.

Ensure smooth transitions, narrative coherence, and depth in every section.

Avoid filler phrases and generic introductions; aim for rich, meaningful content.
